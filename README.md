ClusterNap
==========

ClusterNap is a simple, configurable power control tool for IT infrastructures. 

ClusterNap controls the (power, run) states of your nodes(physical servers, VMs, switches, RAIDS, services) in your system. 
After simply configuring nodes/services dependencies and ON/OFF commands for each nodes, all you have to do is just tell the ClusterNap which nodes you need and which you do not. It will take care if the rest; for example, what other nodes it should turn-on/off in order to turn-on/off you requested/derequested nodes. Moreover, ClusterNap knows exactly in what order it should take turn-on/off actions for the nodes to keep the system graceful.
