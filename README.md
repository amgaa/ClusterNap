ClusterNap
==========

ClusterNap is a simple, scalable power control tool for computer clusters.
Right now this project is on its very early stage. 
But, we will work hard to make it ready as soon as possible. 

With ClusterNap you can control the power state of your cluster easily 
and can still keep the quality of the services your cluster providing at good level.
