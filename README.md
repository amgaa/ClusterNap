ClusterNap
==========

ClusterNap is a simple, configurable power control tool for computer clusters. 

Only by configuring dependencies among the nodes and services in your computer cluster, ClusterNap determines which nodes should be ON and which can be off (or low-power mode). Moreover, it can change the power state of your cluster in exactly right order and can still keep the quality of the services your cluster providing at good level while saving significant amount power consumption.
