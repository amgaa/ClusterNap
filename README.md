ClusterNap
==========

ClusterNap is a simple, configurable power control tool for computer clusters. 

Only by configuring dependencies among the nodes/services in your computer cluster and requested nodes/services, ClusterNap determines which nodes should be ON and which can be off (or low-power mode). Moreover, it can change the power state of your cluster in exactly right order gracefully.
